# Social-Network-API

## Description

This application was designed as a back-end demonstration for a social media platform where a user can log thought posts for all users to view and all users can post a reaction to any thought posts they read. In this application, we use Insomnia to show all of the functions of seeing all users in a JSON format, retrieving an individual user by their ID, looking up all thoughts posted all at once, looking up a single thought by the ID, updating users or thoughts, deleting any users or thoughts, adding friends to a user's list, deleting any friends from a user's list and finally posting or deleting reactions to any user's thought.
